# Advent of Code 2015

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow"
function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs
you to collect fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available
on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star.

Good luck!
