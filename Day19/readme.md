# Advent of Code Day19

 see [here](http://adventofcode.com/2015/day/19) for the description
 
 this one was the big **FU** 2015 played on us as there is some kind
 of insight to the problem input involved if you want to solve part 2
 
 the solution [here](./src/Solution.hs) includes a A* approach that
 will soon run out of memory.
 
 So I took the *cheat* and borrowed the solution from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/3xflz8/day_19_solutions/)
